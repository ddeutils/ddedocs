# Data Observability

**Data observability** is an organization’s ability to fully understand the health of
the data in their systems. Data observability eliminates data downtime by applying
best practices learned from DevOps to data pipeline observability.

## Getting Started

Data observability tools use automated monitoring, automated root cause analysis,
data lineage and data health insights to detect, resolve, and prevent data anomalies.
This leads to healthier pipelines, more productive teams, better data management,
and happier customers.

**The 5 pillars of data observability**:

1.  **Freshness**:

    Freshness seeks to understand how up-to-date your data tables are, as well as
    the cadence at which your tables are updated. Freshness is particularly important
    when it comes to decision-making; after all, stale data is basically synonymous
    with wasted time and money.

2.  **Quality**:

    Your data pipelines might be in working order but the data flowing through them
    could be garbage. The quality pillar looks at the data itself and aspects such
    as percent NULLS, percent uniques and if your data is within an accepted range.
    Quality gives you insight into whether or not your tables can be trusted based
    on what can be expected from your data.

3.  **Volume**:

    Volume refers to the completeness of your data tables and offers insights on the
    health of your data sources. If 200 million rows suddenly turns into 5 million,
    you should know.

4.  **Schema**:

    Changes in the organization of your data, in other words, schema, often indicates
    broken data. Monitoring who makes changes to these tables and when is foundational
    to understanding the health of your data ecosystem.

5.  **Lineage**:

    When data breaks, the first question is always “where?” Data lineage provides
    the answer by telling you which upstream sources and downstream ingestors were
    impacted, as well as which teams are generating the data and who is accessing it.
    Good lineage also collects information about the data (also referred to as metadata)
    that speaks to governance, business, and technical guidelines associated with
    specific data tables, serving as a single source of truth for all consumers.

Together, these components provide valuable insight into the quality and reliability
of your data. Let’s take a deeper dive.
