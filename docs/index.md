# Welcome to **Data Develop & Engineer**

This project will deliver all knowledge from my experience and other sharing
knowledge in Data Develop and Engineer field.

!!! warning

    This project I am working on doesn't have much proper English grammar.
    Because I'm in the middle of trying to practice writing and reading. Please
    understand this issue before going deeper into it.

First, I will start reading the popular Data Engineer books from worldwide. That
have many blogs represent many different books to you, but I see that it has some
book that you should to read that they say you should too.

- [:material-book-open-page-variant: Fundamentals of Data Engineering](abstract/book/book-fundamentals-of-data-engineering.md)
- [:material-book-open-page-variant: Data Pipelines Pocket Reference](abstract/book/book-data-pipelines-pocket-reference.md)
- [:simple-medium: Data Engineer Books](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-engineering-books-f373005d53fc)
  - [Data Engineering with Python]
  - [The Data Warehouse Toolkit]
  - [Architecting Modern Data Platforms]
  - [Spark: The Definitive Guide]
- [:simple-medium: 4 Top Data Engineering Books That Shaped My Career](https://medium.com/towards-data-engineering/4-top-data-engineering-books-that-shaped-my-career-472a519dc34f)
  - [Designing Data-Intensive Applications]

When I start reading, I raise the idea about the future of this my responsibility.
I know the Data Engineering tools will shift so fast because last three year I
start with the map-reduce processing on HDFS but nowadays, it changes to in-memory
processing like Impala or Spark.

!!! quote "What is DE do?"

    **Data Engineering** is the development, operation, and maintenance of data
    infrastructure, either on-premises or in the cloud (or hybrid or multi-cloud),
    comprising databases and pipelines to extract, transform, and load data.[^1]

Then I drop the books to my bookcase and go to start searching about trend of
Data Engineering.

In the future on my job path, if I do not in love with communication or management
knowledge that make me be [Lead of Data Engineer](dae-lead-data-engineer.md), I will go to any specialize
roles on technical data tools such as,

- [DataOps Engineer](dae-dataops-engineer.md)
- [Data Platform Engineer](dae-data-platform-engineer.md)
- [MlOps Engineer]()
