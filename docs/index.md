# Welcome to **Data Develop & Engineer**

This project will deliver all knowledge from my experience and other sharing
knowledge in Data Develop and Engineer field.

!!! warning "Important"

    This project I am working on doesn't have much proper English grammar.
    Because I'm in the middle of trying to practice writing and reading. Please
    understand this issue before going deeper into it :face_holding_back_tears:.

First, I will start reading the popular Data Engineering books from worldwide. That
have many blogs represent many different books to you, but I see that it has some
book that you should to read that they say you should too.

- [:material-book-open-page-variant: Fundamentals of Data Engineering](abstract/book/book-fundamentals-of-data-engineering.md)
- [:material-book-open-page-variant: Data Pipelines Pocket Reference](abstract/book/book-data-pipelines-pocket-reference.md)
- [:simple-medium: Data Engineer Books](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-engineering-books-f373005d53fc)
    - [:material-book-open-page-variant: Data Engineering with Python]
    - [:material-book-open-page-variant: The Data Warehouse Toolkit]
    - [:material-book-open-page-variant: Architecting Modern Data Platforms]
    - [:material-book-open-page-variant: Spark: The Definitive Guide]
- [:simple-medium: 4 Top Data Engineering Books That Shaped My Career](https://medium.com/towards-data-engineering/4-top-data-engineering-books-that-shaped-my-career-472a519dc34f)
    - [:material-book-open-page-variant: Designing Data-Intensive Applications]

When I start reading, I raise the idea about the future of this my responsibility.
I know the Data Engineering tools will shift so fast because last three year I
start with the map-reduce processing on **Hadoop HDFS** but nowadays, it changes
to in-memory processing like **Impala** or **Spark**.

!!! quote "What is DE do?"

    **Data Engineering** is the development, operation, and maintenance of data
    infrastructure, either on-premises or in the cloud (or hybrid or multi-cloud),
    comprising databases and pipelines to extract, transform, and load data.[^1]

Then I drop the books to my bookcase and go to start searching about trend of
Data Engineering.

In the future on this role, if I do not in love with communication or management
knowledge that make me be [Lead of Data Engineer](roles/lead_data_engineer/index.md), I will go to any specialize
roles such as,

- [:material-face-man: **Data Platform Engineer**](roles/data_platform_engineer/index.md)
- [:material-face-man-shimmer: **DataOps Engineer**](roles/dataops_engineer/index.md)
- [:material-face-man-profile: **MLOps Engineer**](roles/mlops_engineer/index.md)

## Communities

This below is the list of communities that must learn about coding knowledge and
Data Engineering tools.
