# Data Mesh

**Data Mesh** is a modern architectural approach in data management and analytics.
It shifts away from traditional centralized data management models
(like data warehouses and lakes) and advocates for a decentralized approach.

Here are the key characteristics and principles of **Data Mesh**:

-   **Domain-Oriented Decentralized Data Ownership and Architecture**

    Data Mesh emphasizes that data should be managed and owned by domain-specific
    teams (e.g., sales, marketing, logistics) rather than a centralized data team.
    This approach allows each team to control and optimize their data based on their
    specific needs and expertise.

-   **Data as a Product**

    Data is treated as a product, with each domain team responsible for the lifecycle
    of the data products they own. This includes ensuring data quality, reliability,
    and usability. Data products are built to be discoverable, understandable,
    trustworthy, and usable by other teams.

-   **Self-Serve Data Infrastructure as a Platform**

    To enable domain teams to manage their data products effectively, a self-serve
    data platform is provided. This platform offers tools and capabilities for
    data storage, processing, and analytics, ensuring teams can access and use
    data with autonomy but without needing to manage complex data infrastructure.

-   **Federated Computational Governance**

    Data Mesh also involves a federated approach to governance. While teams have
    autonomy over their data, there are overarching guidelines and policies to
    ensure compliance, security, and interoperability across the organization.
