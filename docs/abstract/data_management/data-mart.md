# Data Mart

**Data Mart** is a subset of the data warehouse. It specially designed for a particular
line of business, such as sales, finance, sales or finance.
In an independent data mart, data can collect directly from sources.

Data Mart is also a storage component used to store data of a specific function
or part related to a company by an individual authority, so data marts are flexible
and small.

A Data Mart is a subset of an EDW that is designed to serve a specific business
unit or department. It is optimized for querying and reporting on a specific subject
area, such as sales or marketing, and it is typically easier and faster to implement
than an EDW.

    In truth, the Kimball model was for data marts, not a data warehouse.
    A data mart and a data warehouse are fundamentally different things.

    A data mart is a curated subset of data often generated for analytics and
    business intelligence users. Data marts are often created as a repository
    of pertinent information for a subgroup of workers or a particular use case.
