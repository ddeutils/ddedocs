# Data Modeling

**Data Modeling** is a process of creating a conceptual representation of the data
and its relationships within an organization or system. Dimensional modeling is
an advanced technique that attempts to present data in a way that is intuitive
and understandable for any user. It also allows for high-performance access,
flexibility, and scalability to accommodate changes in business needs.

    designers.[^1]
