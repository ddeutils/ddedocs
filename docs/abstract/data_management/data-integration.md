# Data Integration & Transformation

**Data transformation** is the process of taking raw data and making meaning out
of it; it forms the foundation of all analytics work and represents how data
practitioners create tangible value from their companies.

**ETL**: Data is extracted from different sources, transformed to meet analysis needs,
and then loaded into a data warehouse. This can be time-consuming and less adaptable
to changes.

**ELT**: Data is extracted and directly loaded into the data warehouse in its raw form.
Transformation occurs afterward, leveraging the power of the modern cloud-based
data warehouseâ€™s processing capabilities. This approach is more agile and scalable,
accommodating the growing volume and variety of data.
