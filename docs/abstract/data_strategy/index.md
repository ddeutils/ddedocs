# Data Strategy

**Data Strategy** is a long-term plan that defines the technology, processes,
people, and rules required to manage an organization's information assets.
All types of businesses collect large amounts of raw data today.
However, they need a well-thought-out data management and analytics plan if they
want to use this information to make informed decisions and create machine learning (ML)
or generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

A Data Strategy outlines an organization's long-term vision for collecting,
storing, sharing, and usage of its data. It makes working with data easier to do
at every step of the data journey for everyone who needs it in your organization.
