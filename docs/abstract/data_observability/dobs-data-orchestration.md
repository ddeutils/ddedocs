# Data Orchestration

!!! quote

    **Data Orchestration** is a ==Conductor== for the **Modern Data Platform**.[^1]

At the core of a **Data Orchestration Platform** lies a workflow management system
for dependably handling tasks that move and transform data so that it can ultimately
be used to generate artifacts to inform business decisions, including dashboards,
reports, and machine-learning (ML) predictions. However, a data-driven organization
requires capabilities beyond workflow management, in order to increase the availability
of trusted data to a broad base of business users beyond the centralized information
technology group.
