# Services

Service and Cloud Provider that use on **Modern Data Stack (MDS)**.
You can see the below diagram show a **MDS Ecosystem** that include the
**Cloud Services** more than the **Open-Source Stacks**.

:material-page-last: As such, the definition of a **MDS** cannot be clearly stated
since every business tries to adapt modern technologies to their requirements.

However, there are definite features of the modern data stack that identify it:

- Itâ€™s **Cloud-Based**, requires very little maintenance, is easy to install,
  and can scale quickly with little effort.
- It can be used by **Small and Medium-Sized Data Teams**, as it has a lot of
  out-of-the-box functionality and doesn't rely on the number of data professionals.
- It offers a **Lot of Integration Opportunities** for creating a comprehensive
  data ecosystem.

Overall, the **MDS** centerpiece is about democratizing data usage:
^^Making data more accessible, covering different dimensions of business, improving
analytics capabilities, and simplifying the infrastructure^^.

:material-page-last: If the advantages of **MDS** do not seem convincing enough,
let's have a look at how it differs from the **Traditional Data Stack**.

| **Traditional Data Stack**             | **Modern Data Stack**                                     |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Hosted on-premises                     | Hosted in the cloud                                       |
| Has coupled structure                  | Has modular structure                                     |
| Complex setup requiring large IT teams | Less time on technical configuration                      |
| Requires serious technical background  | Suitable for users without extensive technical background |
| Contains traditional RDBMS             | Works with RDBMS as well as big data, unstructured data   |

The **MDS** provides businesses with a bias for action. Creating the MDS enables
organizations to devote more time to analyzing their data and less time engineering
their data processing pipelines.
