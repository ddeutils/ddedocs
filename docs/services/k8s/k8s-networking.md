# Networking

The **Kubernetes network** model makes it possible for different components of a
Kubernetes cluster, like Nodes, Pods, Services, and external traffic, to talk to
each other. Kubernetes is a distributed system, the network plane spans across
our clusterâ€™s physical Nodes. It uses a virtual overlay network that provides a
flat structure for our cluster resources to connect to.
