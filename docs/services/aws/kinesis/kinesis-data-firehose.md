**Kinesis Data Firehose (Amazon Data Firehose)** is a fully managed service for
delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service

Splunk, and any custom HTTP endpoint or HTTP endpoints owned by supported third-party
service providers, including Datadog, Dynatrace, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, New Relic,

that you specified. You can also configure Amazon Data Firehose to transform your
data before delivering it.
