# Delta

!!! quote

    **Delta Lake** is open source software that extends Parquet data files with a
    file-based transaction log for ACID transactions and scalable metadata handling.
    A Delta Lake table is a table created and managed using Delta Lake technology.

**Delta Lake** is the optimized storage layer that provides the foundation for storing
data and tables in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. Delta Lake is fully compatible
with Apache Spark APIs, and was developed for tight integration with Structured Streaming,
allowing you to easily use a single copy of data for both batch and streaming operations
and providing incremental processing at scale.
