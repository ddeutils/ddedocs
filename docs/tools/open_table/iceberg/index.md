**Iceberg** is a high-performance format for huge analytic tables. Companies
like **Netflix, Pinterest, Bloomberg**, etc., have their entire analytical platform
on Iceberg and require a Pythonic way of accessing the data lake.
Enabling Iceberg tables to interact with the large Python ecosystem would be enriching
for the business and data science teams.

!!! note

    [PyIceberg](https://py.iceberg.apache.org/) is a Python implementation for
    accessing Iceberg tables, without the need of a JVM.
