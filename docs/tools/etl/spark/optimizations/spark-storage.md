# Spark: _Storage_

**Storage** optimization in Spark revolves around how data is stored, both in-memory
and on disk. This includes the choice of data formats (like Parquet, ORC) and the
efficient usage of caching and persistence mechanisms.

**Consequences of Suboptimal Storage**:

- Slower Data Access: Inefficient data formats or storage strategies can lead to slower read/write operations.
- Increased Resource Consumption: Poorly optimized storage can consume more memory or disk space, affecting the overall efficiency of Spark applications.

## Handling Storage

- Choose Efficient Data Formats: Formats like Parquet and ORC are optimized for performance, offering advantages like columnar storage and data compression.
- Effective Use of Caching: Caching data in memory can speed up access, but it needs to be done judiciously to avoid excessive memory consumption.
