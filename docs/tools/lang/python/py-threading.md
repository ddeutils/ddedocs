# Threading

## Getting Started

!!! quote

    A thread is the basic unit of execution within a process. It is an independent
    flow of execution that shares the same address space as other independent flows
    of execution within the same process. A process can have one or more threads,
    one of them is the main thread, which is the default thread of a Python process.
