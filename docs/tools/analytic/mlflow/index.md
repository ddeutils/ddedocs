# MLflow

**MLflow** is an open-source platform for end-to-end lifecycle management of
Machine Learning developed by **Databricks**.

**MLflow** offers a variety of features, such as monitoring models in training,
using an artefact store, serving models, and more.
Today we will look at how to use **MLflow** as an orchestrator of a Machine Learning
pipeline.
This is because especially in the world of AI where there are various steps and
experimentation it is critical to have clean, understandable and easily reproducible
code.
