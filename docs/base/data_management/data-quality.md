# Data Quality

Data quality measures how well a dataset complies with the criteria of accuracy,
completeness, validity, consistency, uniqueness, timeliness, and fitness for purpose,
and is fundamental for all data governance initiatives within an organization.
Data quality standards ensure that companies make decisions based on data to achieve
their business objectives.
