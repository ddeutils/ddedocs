# Delta Lake

Delta Lake is the optimized storage layer that provides the foundation for storing
data and tables in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. Delta Lake is open source software
that extends Parquet data files with a file-based transaction log for ACID transactions
and scalable metadata handling. Delta Lake is fully compatible with Apache Spark
APIs, and was developed for tight integration with Structured Streaming, allowing
you to easily use a single copy of data for both batch and streaming operations
and providing incremental processing at scale.
