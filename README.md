# Docs: _Data Developer & Engineer_

> [!WARNING]
> This project will deliver about **Data Developer & Engineer Documents and
> Hands-On** from my experience and reference from public blogs only!!!

I will use this project be a co-pyrot for implement and serve [`MkDocs`](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)
with the [Material Extension](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
for generate documents with static web from a markdown files that easy to deploy
and plug-in with **GitHub** action to GitHub domain.

**Main project page**:

```url

```

## Noted

I will update this project by **Weekly frequency**. (This statement warn to me
when I come back to develop this project again :sweat_smile:)

This project will keep all good information for Data Engineering role, but you will
see that has a lot of knowledge topics do not summarize to my opinion. Because of
shifting of the DE's technologies so fast.

> [!NOTE]
> For more extension that I use for this project, able to research from
> [MkDocs Catalogs](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog).
