I will use this project be a co-pyrot for implement and serve [**MkDocs**](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs)
with the [**Material Extension**](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
for generate static documents website from **Markdown** files that easy to readable
and editing. This document hosts by GitHub page.

## :warning: Noted

This project will keep all good information for **Data Engineer** role, but you will
see that it has a lot of knowledge do not summarize to my opinion. Because of
shifting of the DE's technologies so fast and I do not have time to focus on it.

I will find my core concept of this project as soon as possible. If I do not define
the subjective of this way of this project must go, it will have a lot of confusing
documents.

> [!NOTE]
> For more extension that I use for this project, able to research from
> [MkDocs Catalogs](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog).

## :speech_balloon: Contribute

I do not think this project will go around the world because it has specific propose,
and you can create by your coding without this project dependency for long term
solution. So, on this time, you can open [the GitHub issue on this project :raised_hands:](https://github.com/ddeutils/ddedocs/issues)
for fix bug or request new feature if you want it.
