## Noted

I will update this project by **Weekly frequency**. (This statement warn to me
when I come back to develop this project again :sweat_smile:)

This project will keep all good information for **Data Engineer** role, but you will
see that it has a lot of knowledge do not summarize to my opinion. Because of
shifting of the DE's technologies so fast and I do not have time to focus on it.

I will find my core concept of this project as soon as possible. If I do not define
the subjective of this way of this project must to go, it will have a lot of confusing
documents.

> [!NOTE]
> For more extension that I use for this project, able to research from
> [MkDocs Catalogs](https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog).
